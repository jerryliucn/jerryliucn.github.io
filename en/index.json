The cloud platform handles deployment, auto-scaling, and fault recovery automatically. Elastic Scalability Serverless platforms automatically scale resources up or down based on demand, handling traffic fluctuations without manual intervention. Pay-as-You-Go You only pay for the resources and requests you actually use, saving costs by avoiding payment for idle resources. Faster Development Iteration Focus on business code development, reduce infrastructure configuration and environment setup, and improve development efficiency. High Availability and Security The cloud platform provides high availability, automatic fault tolerance, and security protection, reducing single points of failure and security risks. Serverless enables enterprises and developers to innovate and deliver products more efficiently. It is suitable for microservices, event-driven architectures, API gateways, scheduled tasks, and more.
